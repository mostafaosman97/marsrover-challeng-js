I have completed the Mars rover challenge to explore Mars by entering a set of commands that control the movement of the mars rover and give us a report of the current coordinates and whether there are obstacles in front of it

You can try this by placing a set of commands just flrb
Where
 F -> Move forward on current heading
B -> Move backwards on current heading
L -> Rotate left by 90 degrees
R -> Rotate right by 90 degrees

Enjoy it
